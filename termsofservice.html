                <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1> 
                <ul class="tos-section1">
                    <li>No refunds. This is non-negotiable. Refunds will not be issued under any circumstances.</li> 
                    <li>Payments are 100% up front.</li>  
                    <li>Deposits to book projects are non-refundable. By booking my services, you are committing to the completion of the project. If you do not take the necessary steps to get production started within 3 months of your assigned production date, I reserve the right to cancel the project. This will not result in a refund. Projects that are cancelled due to client negligence are non-refundable.</li>
                    <li>Production may begin when payment is fulfilled and all necessary files are provided by the client. If a project is booked in advance, production begins on the assigned production date.</li> 
                    <li>Clients may request to pay 50% of their project cost up front. A 50% down-payment will cover the initial outline of the project and a first draft. First drafts are minimal concepts of the project that serve to outline the structure of the video or design. Once the first draft is complete, clients must pay the remaining cost before production will proceed. I reserve the right to refuse this option to clients.</li> 
                    <li>Clients must be prompt with communication.  Failure to reply in a timely manner will affect your turnaround time. If a client fails to provide the necessary correspondence in a timely manner, or does not respond to correspondence for 2 months, I reserve the right to cancel the project due to client negligence.</li>
                    <li>I reserve the right to personally showcase client commissions at any time during or after production unless client specifically requests otherwise.</li>
                    <li>All prices are subject to change based on demand by client.</li>
                    <li>If you do not fulfill payment within 72 hours of receiving an invoice, I will consider the project cancelled and move on to other work.
                    Commissions do not have a deadline unless specified before payment is received - I will not accept sudden deadlines after payment - If a specific turnaround time is required, clients must make this clear before production begins. Turnaround times can vary greatly depending on the nature and challenges of a specific project.</li>
                    <li>By commissioning my services you are agreeing to everything listed on this page.</li>
                    <li>Communications will be made via email correspondence only. Do not message me via social media regarding your project.</li>
                    <li>You may not message me frequently asking for updates. I will contact you when I have updates regarding your project.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <h2>GAMING MONTAGES</h2> 
                <ul class="tos-section2">  
                    <li>Clients must provide me with their song of choice.</li> 
                    
                    <li>Clients are responsible for ensuring they have the right to use the music they have selected. Certain video hosting sites may take down videos that use copyrighted material, or they may instead flag your video and allow it to remain posted. I reserve the right to refuse revising a project with new music if the project gets taken down by video hosting sites.</li>  
                    
                    <li>Clips must be trimmed to the section of interest using AVIdemux to avoid quality loss, or contain notes/indication of when action begins. I will not manually search through large files to determine the desired subject of a clip.</li>
                    
                    <li>Quality of footage provided affects the overall look of the product. For the best-looking video, please provide footage at a minimum native resolution of 1920x1080 and a native framerate of 60 frames per second. I reserve the right to use minimal synchronization, frame interpolation, and other time-remapping methods at my discretion on any footage that does not meet this minimum.</li>
                    
                    <li>Provide clips you are certain you want used 
                    - I reserve the right to refuse revisions on the basis that you do not like footage you provided.</li>
                    
                    <li>Filming of non-gameplay footage (cinematics) requires a fee of $75
                    - No charge if you provide your own cinematic shots</li>
                    
                    <li>You will be presented with a rough draft of your project. This will be your opportunity to request changes to the footage and particular clips used. After the product is completed, I will accept up to 2 requested changes to footage. Any further changes will be subject to a fee of $25-$50. I reserve the right to refuse requests for revising a complete product if I feel they are too drastic, and if the client had plenty of opportunity to request said revision prior to the product being completed.</li>
